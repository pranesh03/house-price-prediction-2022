# house-price-prediction
This project focuses on predicting home prices in Boston using the Boston Housing Data Set. A variety of machine learning algorithms are used to create predictive models that estimate home values ​​based on features such as crime rates. Property size Proximity to the job center and more..

The Boston Housing Dataset contains information on various factors influencing house prices in different areas of Boston. The target variable is the Median House Price (MEDV), while the features include:
CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
LSTAT: Percentage of lower-status population
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
TAX: Property tax rate
...and more

Libraries and Tools:
Python: Programming language
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics

Evaluation
Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

In this project We successfully built and evaluated a machine learning model using the Boston housing dataset to predict housing prices in Boston. XGBoostregressor gave the best results. This indicates that the cluster method outperforms simple models such as linear regression.
